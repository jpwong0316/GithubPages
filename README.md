**Some stuff about me**
#####
*Greetings!* My name is Jason Wong ~~not that that wasn't already obvious~~ and I am a third year student at UCSD.

I spend a lot of my time browsing Reddit, watching anime, and playing some gacha games. In fact, I probably spend too much time
doing things that aren't productive. As the legendary Hayao Miyazaki once said:

> Anime was a mistake.
